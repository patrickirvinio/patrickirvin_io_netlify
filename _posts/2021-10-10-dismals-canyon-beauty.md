## Hiking Dismals Canyon - Alabama

<blockquote class="alignleft">“Dismals Canyon is one of only a few places where insects called dismalites (<i>Orfelia fultoni</i>), a distant relative of <i>Arachnocampa</i> can be found. The larval forms of these flies emit a bright blue-green light to attract food and mates. They cover the canyon wall.” <cite>— Wikipedia</cite></blockquote>

**Dismals Canyon** is a beautiful sandstone gorge located in Franklin County, Alabama.  Know for its dismalites (Orfelia fultoni, a distant relative of Arachnocampa), the national landmark is spectacular to hike day or night.  You will need to schedule with the park to do the night tours.

I would suggest good waterproof hiking shoes if the weather is cooler so that you can make all of the water crossings without worrying about wet feet.

I have included a few photos from Dismals below along with a map and park information:
