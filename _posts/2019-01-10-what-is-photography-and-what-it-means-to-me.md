## Hiking Dismals Canyon - Alabama

**Dismals Canyon** is a beautiful sandstone gorge located in Franklin County, Alabama.  Know for its dismalites (Orfelia fultoni, a distant relative of Arachnocampa), the national landmark is spectacular to hike day or night.  You will need to schedule with the park to do the night tours.

I would suggest good waterproof hiking shoes if the weather is cooler so that you can make all of the water crossings without worrying about wet feet.

I have included a few photos from Dismals below along with a map and park information:

<blockquote class="alignleft">“Dismals Canyon is one of only a few places where insects called dismalites ([_Orfelia fultoni_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orfelia_fultoni "Orfelia fultoni"), a distant relative of [_Arachnocampa_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachnocampa "Arachnocampa")) can be found. The larval forms of these flies emit a bright blue-green light to attract food and mates. They cover the canyon wall.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismals_Canyon#cite_note-dismals-2)” <cite>— [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismals_Canyon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismals_Canyon "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismals_Canyon")</cite></blockquote>
